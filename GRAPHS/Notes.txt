1. Adjacency list
For every vertex, its adjacent vertices are stored. In the case of a weighted graph, the edge weights are stored along with the vertices.​


2. Adjacency matrix
The row and column indices represent the vertices: matrix[i][j] = 1matrix[i][j]=1 means 
that there is an edge from vertices ii to jj, and matrix[i][j] = 0matrix[i][j]=0 denotes that there is no 
edge between ii and jj. For a weighted graph,the edge weight is usually written in place of 11.
